this is the response from the lecture,how should I improve?

The product itself has a professional appearance, and has been demonstrated to work well (except for the checkout feature, which should be shown to be operational). There is discussion of a strong requirement definition (citing IEEE 830-1998), but no requirements at all are evidenced, and the dissertation immediately launches into a discussion of the implementation instead. This contains some useful observations about the calls made within the code, but in places seems to not fully comprehend what the code itself is doing (for example, use of 10 salting rounds with BCrypt is stated as using "210 iterations", and Figure 14 is labelled as "User Registration", whereas it is clearly designed to handle user login). There is mention of a "dynamic pricing algorithm" and "recommendation system", but absolutely no details of either are presented, nor do they appear present in the uploaded code base.
The author states that a compound index "performs best in query performance to dietary types of filtering", and suggests a recommendation algorithm has O(log n) complexity, but both these statements are not explained, supported, or referenced to any particular component in the sourcecode, or existing work. MongoDB text indexing is mentioned, but there is no sign in the sourcecode that it has been used. The description of the cart functionality is difficult to understand, and, like much of the implementation write-up, it is provided in isolation to any real context. The author states that the "addItem" method is intelligent (it might more accurately be described as logical, in that it does not attempt to create a new entry for an existing product), and correctly mentions adding to the quantity, but also adding "form for fresh items", which makes little sense. There is discussion of a "full-scale validation network.. pre-checkout", but this appears to refer to code which presents a display of items within the cart to the user (where any invalid data causes an immediate return, or an error to be thrown). No such validation appears present in the provided code.

Details of how the payment mechanism works is lacking, and does not match the code base. Dollars and cents are shown to be in use without explanation, suggesting this code originated from a different country, and PCI DSS compliance is attributed to the "stripe.paymentIntents.create()" call, without any explanation of how this is achieved, or of the potential issues. More seriously, the code in Figure 14 does not exist in the submission, and instead the "payment/verify/route.js" script creates a fake successful result whenever Stripe payment is chosen. This is reasonable for testing, but it breaks the actual Stripe functionality, and there is no clear reason why that was removed from the project, or why a mechanism such as a flag (one which is not hard-coded) was not employed to allow testing to be carried out. There is also an incorrect assertion made that the provision of an integer currency amount to the Stripe API is to prevent "corruption" and issues with "floating point algebra", whereas in fact it is done because the API operates using integers (and it should not be possible to transact in anything except rounded units). Section 6.1.1.5 also contains inaccuracies, errors, and false statements. The term "CRUD" is interpreted as something that administrators can use (as opposed to referring to the four basic operations of persistent storage). Code for creating an administrative user is labelled as "user management", and spoken of as "reusable authorisation logic". A function "verifyAdminAccess()" is mentioned but not present anywhere in the submission, and no evidence is provided to support the idea that 12 salting rounds is "computationally adequate" and represents "industry-standard security". Some odd constructs, "$(or)$" and "$or", are mentioned in reference to checking for an existing user with that email and username, but they are not explained, or present in the provided figure (15). A "pagination installed architecture" is spoken of, but irrelevant to the creation of an admin user, and no such structures are present in the code shown. The discussion of MongoDB contains some issues. There has apparently been a "migration to MongoDB" from MySQL, but there is no mention of any original database -- where has this come from? The author seems unaware of the BSON data structure used by MongoDB, and also provides an incorrect reason for choosing the DB (both MySQL and MongoDB re perfectly capable of handling the complexity of the "product configurations" present, which are not complex at all in practice). It is unclear why "DATABASE_URL" is "famous"; much of the discussion here is irrelevant or inaccurate. Discussion of the database schema is fair, but full of much description of "what's there" and not "why" it is designed in this manner. The diagram has an orphaned table ("orde"). There is mention of keeping a price history for each item, but why there would otherwise be a "dependency on catalog changes" is completely unclear. It is stated that the design enables integrity, scalability, and growth support, but there is no explanation of _how_ this is true, nor does it seem to be an accurate assessment (for instance, how would the schema respond to a large number of users, and a search within them?). Sharding is mentioned, but an understanding of it is not demonstrated.

The lead-in to the presentation of user-facing pages is confused, suggesting that the section will show how schemas / endpoints / components were implemented/designed/used, but this is not the case. The write-up itself again makes general, sweeping statements about the design, which do little to demonstrate knowledge or accurate design. Some errors are evident, such as stating that "isCentre = { true }" somehow facilitates "fast development" and "scalability" -- there is some logic in saying that clear, simple properties aid maintainability and reuse, but the example is too limited to show this. Some useful observations are included (such as stating that React Hook Form is in use for the login pages), but the write-up is mostly focussed on stating what is clearly available on the page, and making sweeping statements about its advantages (such as making the system "reliable" and "usable"). Some technologies/services are mentioned which do not appear anywhere else in the project (e.g. Chainlink), showing that much of what is claimed is incomplete, or not based in fact. Likewise, Hardhat (Ignition?) is named, presumably as the mechanism for modelling smart contracts, but is not used anywhere in the codebase. The Conclusions section of the dissertation includes mentions of concepts such as "transparency vs. overload", "trust anchors", "oracle provenance displays", a "commercial viability assessment", and "risk management" workflows (for cryptocurrency-based transactions) which have no bearing on the work, or do not appear anywhere within it. Although appearing to recognise the issue of transparency and regulatory compliance w.r.t. cryptocurrency use, the work makes no effort to address these concerns; instead, it uses an existing Ethereum library, and does not include any of the facilities hinted at which might have provided interesting functionality (such as advanced wallet handling, or clear process descriptions and choices).

The research and product do not meet the majority of the project's objectives. For example, there is no real evidence of the systematic comparison of Stripe, batched/non-batched Ethereum transactions, and the system does not appear to select a "best payment channel" when attempting to take payments. The site _does_ have some realtime analytics and order tracking, although these are in the context of sales (and no analysis or control of blockchain transactions is included). The study does present an architecture and operational flow, although it is in the form of a fairly standard site design and transaction process. Transactions are conducted through asynchronous calls, and clicking to make a payment is clearly "event-driven" in nature. However, much of the work done is essentially only simplistic, no analysis of "required standards" is included, and there is no discussion of "best practices" in the main context. The objectives are not met to any significant degree: none of the "benefits of blockchain for the retail sector" are concretely defined, payment mechanisms aren't demonstrated to be understood in practice, and there is no real evidence of the evaluation of system performance, strength, or scalability (although good technology choices have enabled some of these attributes). The challenges and factors significant to the addition of cryptocurrency payments to an e-commerce site are not specified, and there is no evidence that smart contracts have been researched in depth, understood, and included in the implementation.


Reflection: 41%

The Reflection section focusses primarily on analysis of the project, with very little reference at all to the student's learning, knowledge and realisation. In fact, much of what is written makes little sense, and some statements are likely to be fictitious. As an example, it is written that "there were regular updates to the library versions with breaking versions, best practices also changed and there were new security issues to be discovered all the time", but no mention of such things are made within the dissertation, nor is it likely that "best practices" changed significantly during the short duration of the project. This section also states that "misconceptions amongst users with regards to gas fees prompted research activities into meta-transactions and hopefully gasless relay patterns", but there is no sign that users offered any such feedback -- potentially, they did not test the platform -- and a "gasless transaction" is not discussed at all in the work.

The reflection which is present is sparse, and does not explore most of the important areas, including discussing how knowledge was gained, how effectively it was applied, and how it will affect the student in their future work and career. It covers the suggestion that the student learned much about blockchain technology and user-centric design, smart contract creation and ways of "improving performance" (which is too vague in scope), and gained some "methodology" for "overcoming complex socio-technical issues" (which makes little sense, and is not evidenced in the dissertation). The student reasonably suggests that encountering issues meant that they had to learn about new concepts and technologies (such as "Layer-2 solutions" and "state channel methodologies", although neither of these are explained), but does not fully reflect on this, or its impact. The section ends with a curious statement: that "true innovation" is not a "solitary endeavour", which seems contrary to the fact that the project's work was conducted entirely by one person; perhaps the intention was to say that knowledge provided by others is essential for acquiring complex information, and performing complex tasks? In general, the section is too vague and undefined to provide any real indication of reflection.


OVERALL: 48%

Overall, this project had the potential to make an interesting and useful contribution towards the adoption of cryptocurrency within popular e-commerce environments, and it does present a product ordering system which does seem to have the ability to make Ethereum payments (although Stripe payments have been disabled), albeit one which is very similar to much existing work in implementation (for example, "mernstack-pizza-ordering-system" by the Github user "MohitCode17"). However, much of the dissertation's discussion is weak or irrelevant, and very few of the originally-defined objectives have been met, which is compounded by a lack of demonstrated technical knowledge, and of provable, useful evaluation. With more effort and focus, a much greater contribution would have been possible.

I hope the above is helpful. Remember that you _must_ make sure you actually carry out any work you've specified in your write-up, you _must_ evidence any claim you're making that might result in additional marks, and you _must_ support any statements you make with clear, definite and referenced arguments which can be reasonably challenged and found to be solid and correct. There were a few key issues as the above shows, but I think mainly you didn't follow your objectives all the way through to analysis with clear and provable actions and data, and you didn't actually devise and evidence testing which would really show whether your idea offered an improvement or not. Having the stripe checkout code inactive (and code which appeared to come from elsewhere, which appeared in the dissertation but not in the code submitted to PATS) wasn't helpful, and there was little evidence of several of the things you spoke of which might've been considered good contributions (such as smart contracts and transaction grouping). The project itself doesn't necessarily have to be massively complicated or represent a huge contribution, but you _must_ show you've done the work and followed good practice throughout, to arrive at supported and useful conclusions.

Please let me know if you need any other information, or if you'd like to discuss any of these points, I'd be more than happy to talk them through with you if you need any additional clarity about anything. In the meantime, don't forget to check the re-sit situation with the COMSC office, and I'll look forward to hearing from you soon. :)

Best wishes,


Dave
